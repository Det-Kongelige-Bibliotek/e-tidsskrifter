# MySQL.  Versions 4.1 and 5.0 are recommended.

# Install the MYSQL driver
#   gem install mysql2
#
# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile

# UMLAUT: mysql db with mysql2 adapter strongly recommended for Umlaut, in both 
# production and development. sqlite3 has unclear semantics under threaded 
# concurrency which umlaut uses, and in many cases simply does not work. 
#
# A higher pool size than ordinary is recommended because of umlaut's
# use of concurrency. Perhaps as large as the number of services
# you have configured to run in the same wave, plus another few.

#   adapter: mysql2

# UMLAUT: for the 'search' functions (A-Z title lookup) to work, you need
# a direct database connection to the SFX database, under 'sfx_db' key. 
# You should manually set up a new read-only MySQL account in the SFX db
# for this purpose, rather than use one of the full-access existing SFX
# mysql accounts.

sfx_db:
  adapter: mysql2
