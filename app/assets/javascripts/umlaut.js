// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into including all
// umlaut files. It can be included in a rails application.js manifest
// as:
//         require 'umlaut'
// to include all umlaut js.


// jquery is required for umlaut, it's okay
// if the manifest chain ends up 'require'ing twice because
// it's mentioned in local manifest, sprockets is smart enough.
